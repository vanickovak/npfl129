The tasks are evaluated automatically using the
[ReCodEx Code Examiner](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/).

The evaluation is performed using Python 3.8, scikit-learn 0.23.2, numpy 1.18.5,
scipy 1.5.2, pandas 1.1.2 and matplotlib 3.3.2. You should
[install the exact version of these packages yourselves](#faq_install).

### Teamwork

Solving assignments in teams of size 2 or 3 is encouraged, but everyone has to
participate (it is forbidden not to work on an assignment and then submit
a solution created by other team members). All members of the team
**must** submit in ReCodEx **individually**, but can have exactly the same
sources/models/results. **Each such solution must explicitly list all
members of the team to allow plagiarism detection using
[this template](https://github.com/ufal/npfl129/tree/master/labs/team_description.py).**
